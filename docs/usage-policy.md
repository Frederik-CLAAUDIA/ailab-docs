The following guidelines are put in place to ensure fair usage of the
system for all users. Our Usage Policy might be updated from time to
time in order to provide the best possible service for as many users
as possible.

Strato is a service made available to all AAU-users. The platform consists of shared hardware, and this only works if the users use the platform as intended. This is why we ask you to consider whether the ressources you have reserved for your instance, are being put to use at the moment. If not, you might be occupying ressources, that another user could benefit from.

### What can AI Student Cloud be used for?
The platform excels in tasks requiring parallel processing capabilities, such as training deep learning models, image and video analysis, and other GPU-accelerated computational work. However, it's not intended for applications that only need CPU processing.

#### Focus on data processing, not storage
AI Student Cloud is designed primarily for data processing, not storage. Our High-Performance Computing (HPC) platform supports complex data analysis and simulation tasks efficiently. This focus ensures our resources are distributed optimally among users.

#### Working interactively
AI Student Cloud is optimized for high-performance computing tasks, requiring significant computational resources. Interactive sessions, such as Jupyter notebook sessions, can lead to inefficient resource use and reduce availability for users running intensive data processing tasks. To ensure optimal utilization of our platform, we recommend performing interactive data writing and testing on your local computer, reserving AI Student Cloud exclusively for executing the heavy-duty processing part of your projects.

### Cleaning up after use
==afsnit omkring hvordan de skal rydde op efter dem==

### Best practices
1. Please be mindful of your allocations and refrain from allocating many resources without knowing/testing/verifying that you indeed can utilise all of the allocated resources
2. Please be mindful and de-allocate the resources when you are no longer using them. This enables other users to run their jobs.
