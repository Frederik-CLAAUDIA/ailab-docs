    ...

??? note "Can I have a graphical user interface (GUI) in AI Student Cloud?"
    No. As a rule of thumb, you can only operate applications through a command line interface. AI Student Cloud is best suited for throughput type computing: queue up your job and come back for the result later. If your project could benefit from running on a GPU cluster but demands an interactive graphical interface, contact CLAAUDIA research support at support@its.aau.dk.

??? note "What software can I run in AI Student Cloud?"
    In principle any software that can run under Linux since the operating system on the servers in AI Student Cloud is Linux. In many cases, it is necessary to encapsulate the software in a container in order to use it. The software must be able to utilise the (NVIDIA) GPUs in the platform. The GPUs cannot automatically accelerate software that was not designed for it.

??? note "Can I use AI Student Cloud as a collaborative platform?"
    Yes - it is possible to share files among different users on the cluster.

??? note "Am I allowed to work with confidential or sensitive data on AI Student Cloud?"
    No. In AI Student Cloud you are only allowed to work with public or internal information according to AAUâ€™s data classification model (classified as levels 0 and 1, respectively).
    
    A similar solution for working with confidentoinal or sensitive data (classified as levels 2 and 3) is being developed.

??? note "Who has access to the AI Student Cloud platform?"
    All researchers at AAU as well as students in relation to relevant projects when approved by supervisor.
