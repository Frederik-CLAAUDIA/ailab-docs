The AI Cloud is a facility consisting of several servers designed to be ideal for training deep learning algorithms. Deep learning is in many cases branded as artificial intelligence (AI) - hence the name AI Cloud. This also makes the facility good for a wide range of computationally intensive work such as numerical simulations and high-performance data analysis (HPDA). See "Overview" in the menu above for more details on what the AI Cloud consists of.
