AI Student Cloud is a service made available to all AAU students. The platform consists of shared hardware, and this only works if the users use the platform as intended. This is why we ask you to consider the following use guidelines.

???+ info "Not intended for CPU processing"
    The platform excels in tasks requiring parallel processing capabilities, such as training deep learning models, image and video analysis, and other GPU-accelerated computational work. However, it's not intended for applications that only need CPU processing.

???+ info "Allocating the right amount of resources"
    Please be mindful of your allocations and refrain from allocating many resources without knowing/testing/verifying that you indeed can utilise all of the allocated resources. 

???+ info "De-allocate resources when no longer needed"
    Please be mindful and de-allocate the resources when you are no longer using them. This enables other users to run their jobs.
   
???+ info "Focus on data processing, not storage"
    AI Student Cloud is designed primarily for data processing, not storage. Our High-Performance Computing (HPC) platform supports complex data analysis and simulation tasks efficiently. This focus ensures our resources are distributed optimally among users.

???+ info "Working interactively"
    AI Student Cloud is optimized for high-performance computing tasks, requiring significant computational resources. Interactive sessions, such as Jupyter notebook sessions, can lead to inefficient resource use and reduce availability for users running intensive data processing tasks. To ensure optimal utilization of our platform, we recommend performing interactive data writing and testing on your local computer, reserving AI Student Cloud exclusively for executing the heavy-duty processing part of your projects.
