## What is AI Student Cloud?

The AI Student Cloud can be thought of as a small-scale
supercomputer. Technically, it is a high-performance computing (HPC)
cluster equipped with general-purpose graphics processing units
(GPUs).

The AI Student Cloud is a facility consisting of several servers designed to
be ideal for training deep learning algorithms. Deep learning is in
many cases branded as artificial intelligence (AI) - hence the name AI Student
Cloud.
This also makes the facility good for a wide range of computationally
intensive work such as numerical simulations and high-performance data
analysis (HPDA).

The AI Student Cloud is a facility at Aalborg University managed by the
[CLAAUDIA](https://www.researcher.aau.dk/contact/claaudia) team.

## How to gain access to AI Student Cloud?

All AAU students can gain access to AI Student Cloud, by filling out an [application form](INDSÃ†T-FORMS-LINK-HER).

Currently AI Student Cloud is suitable for working with data classified as level 0
and 1 on the [data classification model](https://www.security.aau.dk/data-classification).
Data classified as level 2 or 3 is therefore not supported as of now.



## What can I use the AI Student Cloud for?

The AI Student Cloud can be used to run basically any Linux-based application
that you wish. 

Typical examples of applications that you can run in AI Student Cloud are:
deep learning applications using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other deep
learning frameworks; applications built using NVIDIA CUDA or
higher-level libraries such as cuDNN, cuBLAS etc.; any numerical
simulation software that can utilise GPUs for computing.
See also [Application Guides](application-guides/interactive-tensorflow/) in the menu above for examples.
