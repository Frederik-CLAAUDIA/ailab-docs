!!! warning "<span id="time-to-window"></span> to the next service window"

    We will be performing a scheduled maintenance on AI-LAB. The routine maintenance will take place <span id="service-date" style="font-weight: bold;"></span> between <span style="font-weight: bold;">00:01 and 23:59</span>. AI-LAB will be unavailable throughout most of the day. You can still submit new jobs until the beginning of the service window. For jobs that may exceed the service window, please ensure to set a maximum runtime using the parameter `--time` that concludes before <span style="font-weight: bold;">23:59</span> the day preceding the service window. Read more about the `--time` parameter [here](/additional-guides/setting-a-time-limit). Otherwise, these jobs will not be able to start until after the maintenance period. You will receive email notifications ==1 month, 14 days, and 1 day== prior to the scheduled maintenance window.
 
    If you have any further questions please refer your question to CLAAUDIA through the [AAU service portal](https://www.serviceportal.aau.dk/).

## What is AI-LAB?
AI-LAB is designed exclusively for students at Aalborg University, offering [high-performance computing (HPC)](https://www.researcher.aau.dk/guides/research-data/high-performance-computing/introduction-to-hpc) right at your fingertips. Think of it as a mini supercomputer, packed with GPUs, making it a perfect playground for training [deep learning](/glossery/#deep-learning) models, running simulations, and performing high-speed data analysis. 

This platform is home to an extensive collection of [GPU resources](/system-overview/#overview-of-compute-nodes), tailored specifically for machine learning tasks. Whether you're working on image recognition, deep learning tasks, or data processing, AI-LAB is equipped to handle vast processes that benefit from [parallel computing](/glossery/#parallel-computing).

!!! custom "<span class="custom-callout-icon">:octicons-lock-24: How to access</span>"
    First you need to fill out an [application form](https://forms.office.com/e/caEhCRmqVN) to request for access. It can take up to 24 hours before you can access AI-LAB. After getting approval, you can access AI-LAB using a terminal application from your local computer. We will guide you through all this in [Getting Started](/getting-started/preperation).
