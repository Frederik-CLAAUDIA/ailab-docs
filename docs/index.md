### :material-cloud-question: What is AI Student Cloud
The AI Student Cloud is designed exclusively for students at Aalborg University, offering [high-performance computing (HPC)](https://www.researcher.aau.dk/guides/research-data/high-performance-computing/introduction-to-hpc) right at your fingertips. Think of it as a mini supercomputer, packed with GPUs, making it a perfect playground for training [deep learning](/glossery/#deep-learning) models, running simulations, and performing high-speed data analysis.

This platform is home to an extensive collection of [GPU resources](/system-overview/#overview-of-compute-nodes), tailored specifically for machine learning tasks. Whether you're working on image recognition, deep learning tasks, or data processing, AI Student Cloud is equipped to handle vast processes that benefit from [parallel computing](/glossery/#parallel-computing).

#### Purpose
AI Student Cloud isn't just about providing hardware; it's about opening the door to high-performance computing for students, with an educational twist. From simulations to deep learning, it supports a large number of applications, all while fostering an environment where students can experiment, learn, and grow their computational skills. We advocate reading the [Use Guidelines](/use-guidelines/) of AI Student Cloud before getting started.

#### How to access
First you need to fill out an [application form](#)==CHANGE LINK== to request for access. After getting approval, you can access AI Student Cloud using a terminal application from your computer to log into the [front-end node](/glossery/#front-end-node). This is where you'll manage files and submit jobs to be processed on the GPU nodes. It's a shared resource, emphasizing learning how to navigate a queueing mechanism and understand containerization. We will guide you through all this in [Getting Started](/getting-started/preperation).

#### Who manage AI Student Cloud
AI Student Cloud is managed by the [CLAAUDIA](https://www.researcher.aau.dk/contact/claaudia) team. CLAAUDIA is a specialized team within ITS at Aalborg University focused on research data support, particularly skilled in leveraging high-performance computing and cloud resources such as AI Student Cloud. They offer [support](/support) and consultations to help students and researchers navigate through options for utilizing supercomputing resources effectively.
