# Offboarding

The offboarding process of AI Student Cloud is important for promoting responsible usage, maintaining data privacy and security, and managing resources effectively to provide a seamless user experience.

#### Clean up after use
AI Student Cloud encourages responsible usage, which includes cleaning up your user directory for files that are no longer needed. Let's take a moment to tidy up the files associated with this "Getting Started" tutorial (*...if you no longer need the files*).

```console
rm tensorflow_24.03-tf2-py3.sif
rm benchmark_tensorflow.py
```

Before deleting files, remember that you can [transfer files](/getting-started/file-transfer) from your AI Student Cloud directory to your local computer.

#### Deletion of data at the end of the semester
At the semester's end, all your data and user information will be automatically removed from the AI Student Cloud platform. For the spring semester, the deletion date is ==June 31st==, and for the autumn semester, ==December 31st==. You will receive email notifications ==1 month, 14 days, and 1 day== prior to the deletion date. It is important to ensure that you transfer any desired files from the AI Student Cloud to your local computer before the deletion date.

#### Apply for extension
Should you wish to keep your data on AI Student Cloud and use the platform for another semester, you can submit an extension request through the [application form](#)==UPDATE== for the AI Student Cloud. Alternatively, you can apply for a new project when the next semester begins.
